# ExecuteJS
Execute all user-defined functions


# Why
* There are some cases where static analysis of JS fails, So this is a dynamic aproach where we execute all the functions with desired arguments.
* This will be helpful to bughunters where we can capture all the requests.  


# Usage
* Open a website 
* Execute the exec.js contents in console


# To do
* [x] Execute only user defined functions
* [ ] Use Object.getOwnPropertyNames to get methods
* [ ] Analyze and automate frameworks like angular, react.
